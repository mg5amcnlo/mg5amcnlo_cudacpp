# mg5amcnlo_cudacpp

This is the git repository of the CUDACPP code-generating plugin of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (in short "MG5aMC") software framework.

The MG5aMC CUDACPP plugin extends the MG5aMC software framework by allowing the automatic code-generation of source code for the following back-ends:
- vectorized C++, to run on vector CPUs and exploit SIMD
- direct CUDA/C++, to run on NVidia GPUs
